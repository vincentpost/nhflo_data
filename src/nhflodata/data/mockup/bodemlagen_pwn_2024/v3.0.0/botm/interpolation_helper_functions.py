    Ideally, a contour line forms the separation between two polygons but this
    is not always the case due to topology errors and the addition of polygons
    to the Koster (1997) shapefiles from other sources (occurs mostly in the
    southern part of the area).

    Note: [Edinsi report 3.1, p.12 and Section 5, p.38] Edinsi notes that the
    Python script cannot automatically determine values for all contour lines.

    digitization errors, (c) added polygons in the southern part that weren't in
    the original Koster (1997) data. These are flagged with remarks and resolved
    in a manual QGIS editing step (step 5 in the interpolation workflow).
